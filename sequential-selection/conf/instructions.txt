You will see colored shapes, one of which will be cued by a line (the target).

Your job is to report the colors of the two shapes that made up the target.

It might be very hard, but try your best. 

Please pay attention, and try not to move your eyes from the fixation spot!

There will be a few practice trials, followed by the actual experiment. 

Good luck!
