# ColorBinding

## overview:

three families of experiments:

* sequential selection: pick color of one part (from array of 10 colors), then pick color of next part
* simultaneous selection: pick conjunction from 10x10 grid combining all parts and colors
* visual-search: identify one part among distracters of the other part (all monochrome)

## sequential-selection methods

cue appears 400 ms before display of objects

circular display of 22 objects presented for 100 ms

circle center is about 5 degrees from fixation

cue line extends about 3 degrees from fixation

stimulus configuration varies across expt versions (see next section).  All objects are comprised of two parts with different colors

cued target item and the 4 items on either side of it (2 clockwise, 2 counterclockwise) have entirely unique colors for all parts

Test: pick which color went with part A (e.g., vertical bar) out of 10 options, ditto for part B. (which part cued first is random)

## simultaneous-selection methods 

same as simultaneous selection, except during test, subject pick out an object conjunction out of a 10x10 grid which includes every color combination.
